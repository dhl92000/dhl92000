# Hi, I'm Dahee! 🙋🏻‍♀️ 

👩🏻‍💻 Most of my projects use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, but my current learning goals are to get comfortable with TypeScript and React Native, and grow a deeper understanding of accessible and responsive design. 

👀 My passion for frontend design and intuitive user experiences developed because I worked with a lot of users who had trouble navigating applications.

🎾 🥐 When not programming, you'll find me baking or at the pickleball/tennis court!

✅ I'm currently open to work! Feel free to reach out at dahlee97@gmail.com
